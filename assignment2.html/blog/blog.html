                <p>
                    But before you hail a local taxi on the street, here are some tips you should keep in mind when
                    you’re in search of a taxi near me or a local taxi:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="clor">Check the company’s reputation:</span>
                     Before you board a local taxi, especially when you see one on the
                    street, research the company’s reputation.
                </p>
                <p> <span class="clor">Share your ride details:</span> At Welwyn Taxi, we offer a free service to share your details with a friend
                    or an emergency contact. As a local taxi service that runs a 24/7 taxi service anywhere near you,
                    your safety is our priority anytime, any day. Our local taxi service technology helps put peace of
                    mind at your fingertips. All you need to do is click the “share your ride” button, and we’ll
                    automatically share it with your emergency contact.</p>
                <p><span class="clor">Keep valuables with you and do not share personal information:</span> If you’re traveling with valuables,
                    keep your eyes on them at all times to ensure the safety of your travel valuables. Please do not
                    leave them in the taxi to avoid stories and to avoid sharing personal information like house
                    address, unique phone number, card pins, and other financial details with the driver. Our local taxi
                    service doesn’t request all that information, so don’t disclose it to anyone. Do not flash the cash;
                    you need to keep enough smaller notes in an accessible pocket to pay the driver.</p>
                <p><span class="clor">Check and save emergency contacts:</span> An essential part of your travel planning is to check and save
                    emergency numbers for the country or countries you’ll be visiting, especially for the police.
                    Hopefully, you’ll never need to use them. It’s also wise to have a list of trusted contacts saved as
                    emergency contacts on your phone in case you need them or are in an accident and the emergency
                    services need to reach your nearest and dearest. We at Welwyn Taxi run a 24/7 taxi service that
                    allows customers to check emergency numbers if they visit Welwyn City.</p>
                <p><span class="clor">Check and agree on the price before getting into a taxi. </span>At Welwyn Taxi, our local taxi service has a
                    meter that calculates the costs based on the distance traveled. However, that might be different for
                    some other taxi companies, so in cases like this, negotiate the price before getting into the taxi.
                </p>
                <p><span class="clor">Learn a few simple phrases before traveling into a new town:</span> Our drivers at Welwyn City understand
                    the diversity of languages, so we run a 24/7 service that speaks the general public language,
                    English. But in other countries where English is not said, being able to communicate is vital for
                    your safety. Having a working knowledge of or even a smattering of basic phrases in the local
                    language can help enormously. Basic terms include thank you, please, yes, no, okay, stop, and where
                    is…</p>
